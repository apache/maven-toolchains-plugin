JDK Toolchain


* Toolchain Identification

  The toolchain type id for JDK is "<<<jdk>>>".
 
  Predefined identification tokens, for requirement matching, are:

  * "<<<version>>>" marks the version of the jdk. Maven Toolchains Plugin can match against a single version or any version ranges,

  * any other tokens will be accepted, but only exact matches are supported.

  []

* Toolchain Configuration

  There is only one configuration element named "<<<jdkHome>>>". It designates the root directory
  of JDK installation.

* Sample <<<toolchains.xml>>> setup

+---+
<toolchains>
  <toolchain>
    <type>jdk</type>
    <provides>
      <version>1.5</version>
      <vendor>sun</vendor>
      <id>for_mevenide</id>
    </provides>
    <configuration>
      <jdkHome>/home/mkleint/javatools/jdk</jdkHome>
    </configuration>
  </toolchain>
  [...]
</toolchains>
+---+

* Toolchains Plugin Configuration

  For selection of toolchain for use by the project, the following conditions are matched
  against the definitions in the <<<toolchains.xml>>> file:

  * "<<<version>>>" which accepts any {{{/enforcer/enforcer-rules/versionRanges.html}version range definitions}}.
    Version declared by the toolchain needs to fit into the range,

  * any other tokens needs exact match. Toolchain not providing such token will not be selected.

  []

  All conditions need to be satisfied in a sucessfully matched toolchain.

* Sample Plugin Configuration
